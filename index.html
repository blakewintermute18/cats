                <h3>Jeff</h3>
                <p>Jeff will love you. He like to paw your face in a nice way, and will do his best to be great all the time.
                Never have we seen him get violent, with the exception of someone teasing him with food. Don't do that.</p>

                <p>Joey will be nice to you, most of the time. She's a cuddeler,
                    but don't be surprised when she turns around and waps you for petting her too much. She can be unforgiving.</p>
